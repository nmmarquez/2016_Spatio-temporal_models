### We will be using TMB
* C++ functions in TMB can be searched here: http://kaskr.github.io/adcomp/index.html
* The GitHub [Wiki](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/wiki) contains useful information

### Please try to install TMB using one of these methods (I recommend trying #1 first, then trying #2 if #1 fails, etc.)
* Using the standard package install command
```R
install.packages("TMB")
```
* Following directions on their [homepage](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp)
* Using a custom R command
```R
install_github("kaskr/adcomp/TMB")
```

### Class recordings
* We will try to record the class and, if successful, will upload recordings to a [public folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BwWtq3D1od8WZUl6SS1pT3BjdzQ&usp=sharing)
